# Meteor React Tutorial

Source: https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app

To run this app:
* Install Meteor.
* From the `simple-todos` directory, run `$ meteor`.
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` in a web browser.

You can also run the following basic scripts that I've bundled with this project:
* `$ source scripts/start.sh` runs Meteor in the background
* `$ source scripts/test.sh` runs Meteor in test mode (also in the background)
* `$ source scripts/kill.sh` kills all currently running Meteor processes

If running `start.sh` or `test.sh`, log data from the latest instance can be found in `log.txt`.
